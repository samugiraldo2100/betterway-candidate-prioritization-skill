# Candidate Prioritization

## Purpose

Evaluate a collection of candidate profiles against two job descriptions and produce a transparent, evidence-based recruiter contact priority.

The skill analyzes every candidate against both roles, classifies each candidate as Job A, Job B, Both, or Neither, and prepares clear recommendations for human review.

## Critical Rules

- Evaluate candidates only against job-related requirements found in the two job descriptions.
- Review every candidate against both jobs before assigning a final classification.
- Classify every candidate into exactly one overall category: Job A, Job B, Both, or Neither.
- Do not classify or rank candidates using keyword matches alone.
- Support every important recommendation with evidence found in the supplied candidate profile.
- Distinguish missing information from information confirmed to be absent.
- Do not invent experience, skills, education, certifications, location, salary expectations, language proficiency, availability, or employment history.
- Do not use protected or sensitive personal characteristics as evaluation criteria.
- Treat scores and rankings as decision-support indicators, not final hiring decisions.
- Add human-review notes whenever evidence is incomplete, ambiguous, outdated, or contradictory.
- Ensure every candidate appears exactly once in the final overall classification.
- Do not publish a final report to Notion until the evaluation and report have passed validation.

## Required Inputs

Before starting the evaluation, confirm that the available inputs include:

1. Exactly two identifiable job descriptions.
2. At least one candidate profile.
3. Readable content for every file being evaluated.
4. A clear distinction between Job A and Job B.
5. A reliable way to identify each candidate across the evaluation and final report.

If the two roles cannot be identified reliably, stop and ask the user for clarification instead of guessing.

If one or more candidate files are unreadable, incomplete, duplicated, or unsupported, record the issue and exclude those files from scoring until they can be reviewed.
